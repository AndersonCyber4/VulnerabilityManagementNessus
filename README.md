Let's proceed with configuring our VM for credential scans. First, access the Remote Registry properties and set the startup type to automatic, ensuring seamless access for remote interactions. Next, navigate to Advanced Sharing Settings, enabling File and Printer Sharing for enhanced collaboration within the network. To streamline operations, access User Account Control Settings and set notifications to "Never Notify" to minimize interruptions during critical tasks. Lastly, open the Registry Editor and create a new value name "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" in the system file, setting the value data to 1. These strategic adjustments will facilitate secure and efficient credential scans, bolstering our professional security approach:  <br/>
